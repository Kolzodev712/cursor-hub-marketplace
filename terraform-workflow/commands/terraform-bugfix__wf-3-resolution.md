# Systematic resolution (Bugfix WF Step 3)

**Use after:** Bugfix Step 2 — Proposed solution (`/terraform-bugfix__wf-2-proposed-solution`). Implement the fix and verify; keep the change minimal and aligned with the proposal.

## Steps

1. **Cite the proposal:** Reference the design log or the agreed solution and trade-offs. Implement only what was proposed; do not expand scope.
2. **Implement:** Make the configuration changes. Consider state impact (e.g. moved blocks). Keep the diff minimal.
3. **Verification:** Run `terraform fmt -recursive`, `terraform validate`; optionally `terraform plan`. Fix any failures.
4. **Summarize:** Briefly state what was changed and how verification passed.
5. **Record in design log (mandatory):** Append the design log for this bugfix workstream with a **Resolution** section: what was done, verification outcome. If no log exists, create one first (`python .cursor/tools/new_design_log.py --slug bugfix-<short-name>`), then add the Resolution section. Create logs only in `./.cursor/design-log/`. Do not ask — do it.
6. **Verify:** Run `python .cursor/tools/validate_workflow_design_log.py --step resolution` from the project root. If it fails, add the missing Resolution content and re-run the validator. Do not consider the command complete until the validator passes.

Do not refactor unrelated code. If the fix reveals a larger design issue, note it in the Resolution section and suggest a separate design log or the main design-review workflow for follow-up.
