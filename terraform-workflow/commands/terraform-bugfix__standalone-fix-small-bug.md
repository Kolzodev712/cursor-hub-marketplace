# Fix small bug (standalone)

Point the agent in the right direction for **identifying and fixing a small bug** in Terraform config. No multi-step workflow; use when the bug is localized, root cause is findable quickly, and a minimal fix is appropriate.

## Steps

1. **Identify:** Reproduce the issue from the user's description or plan output. Locate the relevant config and behavior.
2. **Root cause:** Narrow down the cause (e.g. wrong reference, missing dependency, incorrect type). Keep scope minimal.
3. **Fix:** Make the minimal configuration change that fixes the bug. Do not refactor unrelated code. Consider state impact (e.g. moved blocks if renaming).
4. **Verify:** Run `terraform fmt -recursive`, `terraform validate`; optionally `terraform plan`. Fix any failures.
5. **Summarize:** Briefly state what was wrong and what change fixed it.

**Design log:** For small bugs you may skip a design log. If the fix has non-obvious trade-offs or the user wants it recorded, create or append a log in `./.cursor/design-log/`. Do not require the full bugfix workflow for trivial fixes.

If the bug suggests a larger design flaw, say so and suggest the **bugfix workflow** (wf-1-investigation → wf-2-proposed-solution → wf-3-resolution) or the main design-review workflow instead.
